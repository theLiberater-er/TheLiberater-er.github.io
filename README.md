This will be the landing page for my portfolio (https://theliberater-er.github.io/). This will contain information about me and will provide access to projects and resources I have developed, like the power automate stuff, my html projects, and maybe even my current efforts. This is an example of another page I made: <a href="https://theliberater-er.github.io/about/contectus.html">Contact Us</a>. This is the link I would use to navigate to different <i>folders</i> (not branches, althought maybe the same logic could be used) to demonstrate my knowledge and some projects I've worked on and completed. For example, <a href="https://theliberater-er.github.io/html/">this</a> is the link to my HTML respository. The link would need to be tweaked to match the destination. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">This</a> is the github docs site that has all the info that I put in this file.
